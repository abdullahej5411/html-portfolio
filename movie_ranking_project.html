            Oppenheimer
            <br />
            <p>It was my Best Movie in 2023 so far. It is Drected by Christopher Nolan. And it's a Masterpiece. The Acting of Cillian Murphy and everyone.</p>

        <li>
            John Wick
            <br />
            <p>It was my Second Best Movie after watching Oppenheimer. But John Wick's All Four Parts are perfect and Awesome without any doubt. I liked all of his four movies.</p>

        <br />
        <li>
            Fight Club
            <br />
            <p>"First Rule of Fight Club is: Never talk about fight club." Mann That was an awesome movie. It is the movie From which a person can take lessons and relate to his regular routine and his stress and fear in life.</p>
